# LJ Code 201 - Day 6
**DOM TREE**
- The DOM tree is something I have some familiarity with because of my preivous work experience with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Both of those tools use the DOM structure to grab and manage data.
- Learning how I can effectively navigate the DOM structure is something I am really excited about.

**DOMAIN MODELING**
- I found both of the articles really helpful in understanding what domain modeling is.
- I have done some work with domain modeling from a marketing side. I had the responsibility to provide our Dev team with fairly extensive specs for new ecommerce features and was asked to loop very carefully at every possible problem.

**OBJECTS**
- excited to be learning more about how I can use and structure data to build better web pages.
