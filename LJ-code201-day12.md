# LJ Code 201 - Day 12
- Working with my first JS library ```Charts.js``` was really fun and a great experience.
- I can see how using JS libraries can save tons and tons of development time. If I had to write every line of code in order to make the chart work on the canvas I would probably loose my mind.

**Code Review:**
- Sometimes the bigger hammer that gets the job done is ok. Just plug your nose and make it work.

**Canvas**
- Important to
    - set context for canvas
        - ```var ctx = canvas.getContent(‘2d’);```
    - Create element
        - ```var canvas = document.getElementById(‘canvas’);```

**CSS Resets**
- use CSS resets on all future projects.
    - always set the reset file first so that it loads before actual CSS style loads
