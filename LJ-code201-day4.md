# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
**CODE REVIEW**
- Key things to remember!!!
 - When writing a script for the first time think through what you want via a visual like a flow chart.
   - then translate your flow charts into semantic code
 - Stacking learning
    - it’s ok to feel lost. Everyone is feeling this way and it’s intentional.
    - https://www.codefellows.org/blog/how-to-accelerate-your-learning-with-stacked-modules/
 - make sure to always test where:
    - the code should be correct
    - the code should fail
    - if looping make sure to test both a completed loop
    - “Developers spend most of their time testing code not writing it."

**Lab - Pair Programming**
- Pair programming is definitely going to have to be a skill I develop over time. It's not something that comes naturally to me. I really found it hard to not just take over the coding to directly write the code over my partners shoulder.
- Using GitHub to fork a repo make edits to it and then merge it back in seems like a really great way to collaborate with others but I am definitely going to need quite a bit more practice with it. My partner and I definitely got out of sync and ended up with some merge conflicts that had to be resolved before we could finish the project.
