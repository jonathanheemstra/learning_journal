**WEEKLY PROJECT**
- By the end of the week things were starting to click for me. I finally was able to reduce the amount of code in my about_me project by roughly 80+ lines.
- I found that writing the script to cycle through my Yes/No questions came to much easier than it had earlier in the week.
- I am pretty proud of that project even though there are still design aspects of the project that I am not crazy about and I think there is stay a way in which I could further reduce the amount of code used. But for now I am happy that it works and that it is a significant improvement over what I had originally written.
