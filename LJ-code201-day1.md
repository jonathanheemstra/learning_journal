# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
**Code Fellows Orientation**
* Learning to write code is about more than just getting a new career it's about gaining the skills necessary to impact my community, my country, and the world.
* Follow the golden rule - treat others as you would like to be treated

**Syllabus**
* *turn things in on time!!!*
* participate in labs
* be a help to your classmates

**UNIX & GIT**
* Treehouse has a great course on getting up and running with Git and GitHub
 * [Git Basics Course on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
* Right now all the commands in UNIX and Git are kind of intimidating. I think the most challenging aspect will be remembering the order of operations for how to use the commands. If I could summarize UNIX it would be "with great power comes great responsibility".

**Lab**
* Writing repetitive code over and over is not a great experience and I look forward to learning more about using functions and loops to better practice the D.R.Y. principle.
