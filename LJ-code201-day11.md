# LJ Code 201 - Day 11
- Today was by far the hardest lab I had encountered so far. I wasn't able to finish all of the requirements and found myself struggling to get the project done.
- I need to remember that sometimes the solution that works is the best solution for now and that striving for excellence will not always be worth it.

**CSS wireframe review**
- why use ```display: inline-block``` instead of ```display: inline``` for the ```li``` nav lists?
    - ```display: inline``` does not allow for specifying of dimensions (i.e. margin, width, etc.)
- Learn how to write great CSS by looking at others code that is done well.

**Lab**
- most elegant solution should use only 1 event handler
    - won’t need preventDefault
    - attach event listener to the container holding all 3 images
- writing user stories
    - marketing wants click data
    - Dev wants to organize code, manage clicks
    - end user wants
- read up on how to remove event listener
- need to know how many times an image is shown and how many times it’s clicked
