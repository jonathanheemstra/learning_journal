# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
**GIT ACP**
* Git is amazing. Such a helpful tool and thankfully I am finally able to confidently use the terminal.
* Important Git commands to keep in mind
 * git add _file name_
 * git commit -m "_commit message_"
 * git push origin master
   * origin = GitHub (aka remote)
 * git status

**HTML**
* There are lots of great tools online to learn more about HTML structure.

 **CSS**
 * Learning how the box model of CSS works is super helpful in understanding how CSS can style content. I had an "a ha" moment when I realized how helpful thinking of HTML as a box structure was.
 * Learning how CSS styles cascade is definitely something that is going to take me some time.


 **JavaScript**
 * remembering to use semantic names is super important for writing good clean JavaScript
 * ALWAYS remember to end javascript statements with a semicolon!!!
